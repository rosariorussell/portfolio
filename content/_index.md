My expertise is in automating operations and accounting systems. After realizing the accounting profession could be automated, I transitioned to software engineering. Over 2 years of experience as a full stack developer with <a href="http://bit.ly/rrcerts">over 30 certifications</a>. Expected date of CPA licensure: August 2020.
