TopCofounder is a "startup as a service" product.

Our process produces a portfolio of scalable companies using a startup factory model. We create and develop companies from internal ideas. These are usually in the areas of machine learning, big data, internet of things, and software as a service.

Our first step is to produce a prototype within weeks. Once validated by paying customers, we attract seed capital to begin scaling operations. Finally, we recruit a CEO from within our network of diverse entrepreneurs. The CEO will take over operations. TopCofounder will continue to serve in an advisory capacity as the majority stakeholder.
