As an accountant and software engineer, I've had the opportunity to work with several startups in different capacities. After experiencing many failed ventures, I decided to work on a business model that reduces the risk of failure while maintaining a high possibility of success. My company is the culmination of over a year of research on that topic. 

TopCofounder's mission is to help angel investors validate business ideas and launch startups quickly with minimal initial capital requirements. Our unique "Startup as a Service" option for investors drastically reduces their initial capital requirements. By offering equity on a monthly subscription basis, overall risk is reduced without compromising on future returns.

TopCofounder utilizes a startup studio model optimized for testing initial hypotheses, building prototypes, and automating digital marketing. Once the business reaches product-market fit, we scale operations and begin fundraising. A startup studio is a portfolio company that launches multiple startups simultaneously. The benefits of this approach include economies of scale as well as the ability to divert resources away from failing startups towards the ones that show more potential. Within this business model, TopCofounder takes several unique strategic approaches for each phase of a startup’s lifecycle.

<b>Ideation phase</b>

- Racer strategy - Duplicate already proven business plans in other parts of the country or world. Or apply a proven business plan to a new industry. This allows the startup to focus less on innovation and more on execution in the earliest part of the startup’s lifecycle.
- B2B - Focus on business process automation (technology-enabled automation of complex business processes) and software as a service to leverage technology in underrepresented niches. Higher revenue per transaction as well as additional opportunities for enterprise solutions.

<b>Validation phase</b>

- Low budget ad campaigns - With a budget of under $1000, invent a brand, create a landing page to collect emails, and send surveys to gauge interest for interested parties. Survey questions would ask - Would you use this product? How much would you pay? What factors would lead you to switch from your current behavior?
- Convert prospects - Have at least one letter of intent before moving on to the build phase.

<b>Build phase</b>

- Scrum - Build phases last up to 1 month each. At the end of each phase, a new version of the prototype will be released. New versions will continue to be released until product-market fit has been achieved.
- Reproducible & Serverless - A serverless approach to software engineering allows resources to automatically scale without any code changes. A small team is able to build infrastructure scalable to millions that costs $0 if no one uses it. Because the code is owned by the startup studio, it can be reused as a template for future projects. This further decreases the initial capital required to get a technology startup off the ground.

<b>Scale phase</b>

- Inbound marketing - Produce content to pique interest in potential investors. Make use of bots, scrapers, and other technology to automate lead generation.
- Recruiting - Upon raising additional funding, TopCofounder recruits someone from Mensa, the high IQ society to take over operations.
