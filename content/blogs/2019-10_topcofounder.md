My company, TopCofounder, is developing a business model to help investors and corporations validate potential startup opportunities quickly with minimal capital requirements.

We compete in the growing startup studio market, which has roughly doubled every 4 years. A startup studio launches multiple startups simultaneously and tries to scale them up quickly. By taking this approach, startup studios can transfer resources between projects and iterate on those that show the greatest potential.

TopCofounder’s business model takes several strategic approaches which differentiate us from the rest of the competition. 

1. Racer studio - Also known as the copycat model which tries to improve upon startups that have already demonstrated success. These can also be new companies which are only deployed in selective parts of the country or internationally.
2. B2B - Higher revenue per transaction, rationally driven purchasing decisions, easier to customize product in a niche B2B market.
3. Lengthy validation process - Which starts before the product is ever built. Have at least 3 customers interested in paying for the product before it is ever built.
4. Outsource labor - Most of the internal operational work is product management. Marketing and development is outsourced to cheaper overseas labor. This reduces initial upfront investment and enables resources to quickly transfer to a higher priority project.
5. Serverless technology - An approach to software engineering that allows resources to automatically scale up or down. This enables a small team to build infrastructure that scales to millions of people and also costs $0 if no one is using it.
6. Fundraise early - Offer service for free or at a discount to gather usage data and trends for investor confidence. Seek seed funding for one year of runway

TopCofounder is essentially a portfolio company. As soon as one of our spinoff companies raises seed funding, we’ll recruit for a full-time executive to take over the company and stay on as majority shareholders. Our pool of executive prospects originate from Mensa, the high IQ society.  

I am looking to form a joint venture with angel investors or corporations looking to build innovation labs. For this venture, I am seeking $80,000 for a 50/50 split to build a prototype, acquire initial customers, and raise additional seed funding.
