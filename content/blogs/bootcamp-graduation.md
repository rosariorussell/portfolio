The 6 month bootcamp has been a great experience. There were so many moments of frustration during the whole process. Compared to my graduate degree in accounting and undergraduate degree in Biology, I would say that the bootcamp was the most challenging of all. 

After the bootcamp, I was recommended for the teaching assistant position for the following cohort. I think that teaching is the best way to learn a subject and it will be a great next step for me as a developer.

At this point, I've only covered the basics and I still have a long way to go. I want to continue my learning by moving on to AWS as well as completing a few more projects on my own.
