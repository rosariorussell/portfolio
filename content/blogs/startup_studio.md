After launching my new company TopCofounder (<a href="/blogs/topcofounder/">see detailed post here</a>) I began the initial phase of market research. I eventually stumbled upon the idea of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_studio">startup studio</a> and had my first major epiphany. In my favorite book, Antifragile, Nassim Taleb describes antifragility as the characteristic of things that improve under stress and volatility. The startup studio model is an antifragile approach to company building. Instead of risking everything on the success/failure of 1 company, I can build a process that pumps out workable prototypes in weeks.

I read through the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Startup-Studio-Playbook-entrepreneurs-framework-ebook/dp/B07NVNYM4C">Startup Studio Playbook</a> multiple times. This is the best resource on the topic. I began networking with startup studio founders around the world and researching best practices. I even began working for a startup studio in Miami called <a href="https://labventures.co/">Lab Ventures</a>. This experience at Lab Ventures was vital for me because I got to see exactly what did and did not work.

Now, I am ready to work on TopCofounder full-time. Although still related to my original concept, I am pivoting TopCofounder closer towards a startup studio model. This is how I describe it:

TopCofounder is a “startup as a service” business.

Our process produces a portfolio of scalable companies using a startup factory model. We create and develop companies from internal ideas. These are usually in the areas of machine learning, big data, internet of things, and software as a service.

The first step is to produce a prototype within weeks. Once validated by paying customers, we attract seed capital to begin scaling operations. Finally, we recruit a CEO from within our selective pool of entrepreneurs (1 out of 50 applicants). The CEO will take over operations and TopCofounder will remain the majority stakeholder.
