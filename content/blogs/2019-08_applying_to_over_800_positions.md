While consulting with different companies has its benefits, I found myself really disliking having to continue to find new clients every few months. I was overloading myself with my own projects while also wanting to pursue a CPA license. So I decided to look for full-time work. I spent over 40 hours a week applying and interviewing over the last month. 

In addition, I knew that it would be hard to get my resume to the top of a huge stack so I applied to as many jobs as possible. This meant that I would apply to every job with an "Easy apply" option. I would also skip reading the job description. I figured I would read the description if I got a call back. I looked for accounting and development jobs in the tri-county area which allowed me to apply for around 800 jobs. Most of these I was either over or under qualified. As a result, I only got around 20 interviews - a very poor percentage but pretty impressive number.

I noticed a huge difference in my results closer to the end of the month as I improved on my interviewing. Early on, I didn't really know how to sell myself because I hadn't had a formal interview in 7 years. Out of the 20 interviews, I received 4 offers. Success!

Here are some of the epiphanies I realized over the last month:

- I print the job description, responsibilities, and requirements and go through each of them line by line during the interview. 
- I ask the employer directly if they have any concerns about my suitability for the position so that I can address them.
- The following day I send an email summarizing my thoughts on the position, reassure their potential concerns about my choice as a candidate, and emphasize what separates me from every other candidate they will interview.
- The vast majority of recruiters are HORRIBLE. These people are paid around 15% of the first year's salary and probably deserve closer to 1%. They provide very little value to a candidate outside of putting the resume at the top of the stack. Despite what they say, the recruiter works for the employer, not the employee.
