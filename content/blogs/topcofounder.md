I have always been interested in entrepreneurship and participated in several startup events in Miami over the years. Both from observation and personal experience, I realized that the hardest part of the whole process is finding a team that compliments one another and works well together. A poor idea can be made into a profitable business with the right team behind the endeavor.

In 2017 I was invited to join Mensa, the high IQ society. My immediate thought was that Mensa membership would be a great networking opportunity. However, Mensa did not meet most of my expectations (<a href="/blogs/mensa/">as detailed in this post</a>). In summary, Mensa is mostly a social club for people that congratulate themselves for a high test score.

Fortunately, Mensa allows its members to organize "Special Interest Groups". I took the initiative to formalize a networking group and within a few weeks gathered over 50 members to join. A few months later, I began working on the website and today I launch <b><a href="http://www.topcofounder.com">TopCofounder</a></b>!

In partnership with Mensa, the high IQ society, TopCofounder matches you with elite entrepreneurs having the domain expertise that your business needs. Although created for Mensa and International Mensa, the group is open to the public through application. In addition, the public is free to submit business proposals and hire/work with someone from the group.
