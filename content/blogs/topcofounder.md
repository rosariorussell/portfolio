I have always been interested in entrepreneurship and participated in several startup events in Miami over the years. Both from observation and personal experience, I realized that the hardest part of the whole process is finding a team that compliments one another and works well together. A poor idea can be made into a profitable business with the right team behind the endeavor.

In 2017 I was invited to join Mensa, the high IQ society. Mensa allows its members to organize "Special Interest Groups". I took the initiative to formalize a networking group and within a few weeks gathered over 50 members to join. A few months later, I began working on the website and today I am launching <b><a href="http://www.topcofounder.com">TopCofounder</a></b>!

Although I haven't finalized a business plan, I will be working out some of the finer details over the next few months. As of now, TopCofounder is an exclusive networking group to connect with diverse entrepreneurs from around the world.
