I'm back at my alma matter! After completing undergraduate, graduate, and certificate programs at the University of Miami, I now begin teaching there!

After graduating from the bootcamp, the bootcamp recommended me for the teaching assistant position in the following cohort.

I am excited for this role. Everything I learned as a student will be reinforced by my teaching it to others. When I first started the bootcamp in January 2018, I thought I was so far away from being able to teach the material. But a little over a year later, I begin doing what I thought was impossible.
