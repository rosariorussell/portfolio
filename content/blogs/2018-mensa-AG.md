One day last year, I wanted to test my IQ. I had previously taken the bogus online tests but I wanted to see how I would with an official test. I found an organization called Mensa which proctors tests across the country. Upon receiving my results a week later, they also offered admission into their "secret group" in exchange for membership fees. Mensa calls itself the high IQ society so I was quite curious to see what goes on in these secret "Bilderberg" type meetings. Also, their Annual Gathering would be taking place the following month in South Florida, my backyard.

The AG usually has close to 2000 members gathering from around the country. My first AG in 2017 turned out to be a lot of fun. I really enjoyed being around a bunch of quirky and strange geniuses. There is also a convention center size game room with hundreds of different board games open 24 hours. I made a lot of friends.

The Miami chapter of Mensa hosts one event a month and I stopped going after about 3 meetings. My expectations for the "High IQ" society were that they would collectively utilize their intelligence to do something productive. In actuality, it turned out to be more of a social club.

Within Mensa, they allow members to create "Special Interest Groups" (SIG). I decided to coordinating a couple SIGs effectively allowing me to network within the group based on common interest. The SIGs I created were for Objectivism philosophy and Business networking. Both of these groups are doing quite well with membership growth, but lacking in engagement. I am going to experiment with ways to improve these metrics.

Now in July 2018, I am attending my 2nd AG in Indianapolis. The picture below is for a Toga party in Gen X SIG (I didn't follow dresscode). Since most of the attendees are a lot older than me, I usually spend a lot of my time in Gen X SIG suite. By the end of the week, I again enjoyed myself and made a lot of new friends. I hope to attend next year's AG in Phoenix.
