I have always been interested in entrepreneurship and participated in several startup events in Miami over the years. Both from observation and personal experience, I realized that the hardest part of the whole process is finding a team that compliments one another and works well together. A poor idea can be made into a profitable business with the right team behind the endeavor.

In my <a href="/blogs/2018-08_mensa_annual_gathering/">previous post</a>, I stated my ongoing interest in Mensa would focus on the professional networking group that I was coordinating. After formalizing the group, I was quickly able to gather over 50 members. A few months later, I began working on the website and today I am launching <b><a href="http://www.topcofounder.com">TopCofounder</a></b>!

Although I haven't finalized a business plan, I will be working out some of the finer details over the next few months. As of now, TopCofounder is an exclusive networking group within Mensa to connect with diverse entrepreneurs from around the world.
