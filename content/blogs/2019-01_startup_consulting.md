I just started a new consulting job with Lab Ventures. Lab Ventures is interesting because it my first experience with "startup studios". A startup studio is a studio-like company that aims at building several companies in succession. Lab Ventures has 3 companies that it is currently building and I am working with each of them in different capacities.

Expetitle - a virtual title company. I am helping coordinate outreach marketing campaigns during its pre-seed stage.

OrderOut - integrates food delivery platforms directly to a restaurantâ€™s POS. I am helping with product management during its seed stage.

Partsium - a B2B auto parts marketplace in Colombia. I am helping with quality assurance during its seed stage.
