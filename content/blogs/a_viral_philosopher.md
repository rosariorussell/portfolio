In my early 20s, I explored many ideas and had a knack for engaging in debate with people that had fundamentally differing philosophies. To me, it didn't make much sense staying within an echo chamber and never evolving. Constantly articulating thoughts with people in disagreement forces a refinement in thought and delivery to be more effective.

A philosopher is a meta-thinker, someone who thinks about thinking. However, a philosopher that no one hears is a useless philosopher. The 3 philosophers which have had the most influence over my thinking are Ayn Rand, Nietzsche, and Bruce Lee. All 3 have produced works that live on today well past their deaths. I wanted to follow in their footsteps.

I wanted to share my ideas with as many people as possible and I knew that having an engaging platform online would be the most effective medium. The dilemma I faced (and still encounter today) is whether the material should be written for high engagement or high quality. I decided on a mix of both and created <a href="https://howtonotgiveafuck.com/">How to not give a fuck</a> almost 7 years ago. Since I was very familiar with Reddit, I used it as my primary means of distributing content. Much of my work was consistently hitting the front page of Reddit and my following increased immediately.

As Reddit grew, so did my following without me having to do much work. Every few months I would experiment with new ideas to see what would work. I tried creating different types of content and marketing in innovative ways. I tried to monetize by offering a cryptocurrency and selling shirts. Over 95% of the things I tried failed. But over 7 years, I am happy with the 5% that works, and I can finally say that the site is complete.

The results have been mind-boggling and I'm always shocked to see the numbers. The reddit following has grown to over 300k members. All content branded under "How to not give a fuck" has received over 35 million pageviews. It is humbling to think of the influence I've had on so many lives. There have been hundreds of people thanking <a href="https://howtonotgiveafuck.com/">HTNGAF</a> and some even stating that it has kept them away from suicide. I save these messages as a reminder of the positive influence I can have on the world and it always provides a source of motivation to continue doing what I'm doing.
