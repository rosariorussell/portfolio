My company, TopCofounder, is developing a business model to help angel investors build startups quickly while minimizing capital requirements.

We compete in the growing startup studio market, which has doubled every 4 years. A startup studio is a portfolio company that launches multiple startups simultaneously. The benefits of this approach include economies of scale as well as the ability to divert resources away from failing startups towards the ones that show more potential.

Within each phase of an early startup’s lifecycle, TopCofounder’s business model takes several strategic approaches which differentiate us from the rest of the competition. 

<b>Ideation phase</b>

- Racer strategy - Duplicate already proven business plans in other parts of the country or world. Or apply a proven business plan to a new industry. This allows the startup to focus less on innovation and more on execution in the earliest part of the startups lifecycle. 
- B2B - Higher revenue per transaction means fewer initial customers before breakeven. There are also opportunities for additional revenue for niche customer solutions. With larger corporates, a higher priced tier can be offered.

<b>Validation phase</b>

- Inbound marketing - Produce material to get the conversation started and pique interest in partners. Make use of bots, scrapers, and other technology to automate lead generation.
- Term sheet - At least one term sheet or letter of intent prior to moving on to the build phase. This customer will have top priority over any other future customers and discounted pricing.

<b>Build phase</b>

- Minimal initial capital - <$10k/month to build prototype. Serverless approach to software engineering that allows resources to automatically scale up or down. This enables a small team to build infrastructure that scales to millions of people and also costs $0 if no one is using it.
- Scrum - build phases which last up to 1 month each. At the end of each phase, a new version of the prototype will be released. New versions will continue to be released until product-market fit has been achieved.

<b>Scale phase</b>

- Analytics - Begin developing, measuring, and tracking KPIs that investors are interested in.
- Recruiting - Upon raising additional funding, TopCofounder recruits someone from Mensa, the high IQ society to take over operations.

I am looking to form a 50/50 joint venture with interested angel investors. In exchange for one year of operational expenses (less than $10k/month), I will build a prototype, acquire initial customers, and raise an additional round of funding. As an accountant and software engineer, I've worked on several early stage startups and had first-hand experience with common obstacles faced by these ventures. I began to analyze ways to reduce risk while maximizing success and I launched TopCofounder as a startup studio in 2019 to solve these problems. As of October 2019, TopCofounder is currently working on 3 startups.
