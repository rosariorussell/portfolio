My company, TopCofounder, is developing a business model to help angel investors build startups quickly while minimizing capital requirements.

We compete in the growing startup studio market, which has doubled every 4 years. A startup studio is a portfolio company that launches multiple startups simultaneously. The benefits of this approach include economies of scale as well as the ability to divert resources away from failing startups towards the ones that show more potential.

Within each phase of an early startup’s lifecycle, TopCofounder’s business model takes several strategic approaches which differentiate us from the rest of the competition. 

<b>Ideation phase</b>

- Racer strategy - Duplicate already proven business plans in other parts of the country or world. Or apply a proven business plan to a new industry. This allows the startup to focus less on innovation and more on execution. 
- B2B - Higher revenue per transaction means fewer initial customers before becoming sustainable. It also allows for the opportunity to pivot based on the needs of a single customer.

<b>Validation phase</b>

- Marketing technology - Use of bots, scrapers, and other technology to automate lead generation
- Letter of intent - Acquire at least one LOI prior to starting development of the prototype

<b>Build phase</b>

- Outsource labor - TopCofounder acts as the product manager while outsourcing development to offshore teams. Estimated cost for generic prototype based on 2 developers (frontend and backend) at $2000/developer/month at 3 months ~ $12k
- Serverless technology - An approach to software engineering that allows resources to automatically scale up or down. This enables a small team to build infrastructure that scales to millions of people and also costs $0 if no one is using it.

<b>Scale phase</b>

- Pricing - A long trial period or deeply discounted price for beta users until enough data is collected to garner investor interest
- Post-seed - After raising one year of runway, TopCofounder recruits someone from Mensa, the high IQ society to take over operations.

I am looking to form a 50/50 joint venture with interested angel investors. In exchange for one year of operational expenses, I will build a prototype, acquire initial customers, and raise an additional round of funding.

My name is Russell Rosario and I’m an accountant and software engineer. After a year of consulting with several startups and formulating best practices, I launched TopCofounder as a startup studio in 2019. As of October 2019, I am currently working on 3 startup ideas.
