As I continue to flesh out the business plan of TopCofounder, I am continually being introduced to new concepts. Recently I learned about the idea of a "Fractional Executive". Fractional Executives are on-demand professionals who are not full-time employees. This is a major benefit to startups, with volatile cash flows and immediate short-term goals. By allowing the startup to pay for quality human capital services as needed, they can more efficiently utilize their expenses. In addition, the opportunity to offer equity makes exchange more valuable for both sides.

TopCofounder will continue to function as a startup studio, but for its own internal processes and ideas. For external opportunities, TopCofounder's primary function will be as a matchmaker, finding the missing Fractional Executive(s) needed for a startup's success.
