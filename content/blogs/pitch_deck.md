A few weeks ago, I finally arrived at a solidified business plan. Since then, I've been working on putting together a pitch deck for potential investors. It was a long process because I found it difficult to adequately articulate complex ideas in a short amount of time. Terms like "fractional executive" and "startup studio" leave listeners with more questions than answers. But I believe I've gotten past these issues and I like the final result.
