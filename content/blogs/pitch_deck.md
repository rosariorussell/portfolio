Over the last few weeks, I've worked on solidifying a business plan and putting together a document to summarize my mission. The pitch deck itself took several days to complete after weeks of research. The long process enabled me to better articulate the business and future vision. In the past I've had trouble explaining how terms like "fractional executive" and "startup studio" fit with what I was trying to accomplish. With this pitch deck, I can now easily share the vision I see for TopCofounder with others. You can see the pitch deck <a href="http://pitchdeck.topcofounder.com">here</a>.
