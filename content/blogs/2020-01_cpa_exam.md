My undergraduate degree in Biology/Chemistry meant that I lacked many the 30+ business credits needed to become a licensed CPA. Last August I enrolled in 5 business classes at Miami Dade College in order to sit for the CPA exam. Now, I have been approved to sit for the exam. I still have another 18 credits to go before I can become licensed, but I will focus on that after I pass the exam.

In order to pass the exam, I have also eliminated all work commitments and purchased Surgent CPA review. I will be entirely focused on becoming a fully licensed CPA by August 2020. At that point, I will have an extremely rare skill set that will open up many possibilities for my career.
