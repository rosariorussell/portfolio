I cofounded a new company - <a href="http://www.medicosolutions.com">Medico Solutions</a>. I will serve as CTO/CFO.

Our niche is temp and permanent physician placement while eventually building a "one stop shop" for all specialty healthcare positions. Our vision is to be the nation's most advanced and automated healthcare staffing and placement firm by bringing the employer and employee closer through seamless automation.

A shortage of physicians in developed regions is expected to drive the growth of the healthcare staffing market. The nation-wide market size is 29.86B in 2018 and is expected to grow to 43.6B by 2025. Florida comprises over 10% of this market. The Locum Tenens segment is projected to experience the fastest growth within this and this will be the initial focus of our business venture. A locum tenens physician works in the place of the regular physician when that physician is absent, or when a hospital or practice is short staffed. 

We are currently in the last stages of development and plan to launch in January 2020.
